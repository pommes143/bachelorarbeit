- Mutation testing starting -

These are the steps:
1. A full test suite run will be made to make sure we
   can run the tests successfully and we know how long
   it takes (to detect infinite loops for example)
2. Mutants will be generated and checked

Results are stored in .mutmut-cache.
Print found mutants with `mutmut results`.

Legend for output:
KILLED Killed mutants.   The goal is for everything to end up in this bucket.
TIMEOUT Timeout.          Test suite took 10 times as long as the baseline so were killed.
SUSPICIOUS Suspicious.       Tests took a long time, but not long enough to be fatal.
SURVIVED Survived.         This means your tests need to be expanded.
SKIPPED Skipped.          Skipped.

1. Using cached time for baseline tests, to run baseline again delete the cache file

2. Checking mutants
