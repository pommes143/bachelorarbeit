Task:2:


    write a unit test with the informations above

    description only:

        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0]


    few shotwithout code:

    few shot with code:

        [0.625, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5, 1.0, 0]



    
The things above are the parts of the description of a programming task.
Now write me a Unit test with several simple but well thought-out asserts in python for to validate the code that was
given above.
Think of the imports.
Be thourough.
