#taskdescription
Create a function that finds the largest perfect square (a number that is a square of an integer) in a list of numbers and returns it. If no perfect square is found, the function should return None. 
You can implement this task with the following function using the **math.isqrt()** function from the **math** package to check if a number is a perfect square, but feel free to explore other options!

numbers1 = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
assert largest_perfect_square(numbers1) == 25, "It seems that the largest sqaure is not found correctly."

numbers2 = [8, 10, 15, 18, 20]
assert largest_perfect_square(numbers2) == None, "It seems that the case for None is not implemented."
