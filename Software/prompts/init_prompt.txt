Below is a docstring that describes a function, 
the function that implements it and its use-cases.
Now your job is to create in-depth Unit tests for the code below.
Also think to cover the hidden implicit edge-cases.
Only Work with Integers or Floats.

#docstring
Create a function that checks if a given list of numbers contains any negative numbers. 
The function should return True if there are negative numbers and False otherwise. 
(**HINT** you can use "any()" to check the list)

#file_name to import
contains_negative.py
that file is in a subfolder named "classes_to_test"

#function
def contains_negative(numbers):
    return any(num < 0 for num in numbers)

#Use-Cases
contains_negative([13,324,123,87,-4545,8878,45])
contains_negative([2,1123,233])
